# Flexible Playoff Advancement - Documentation

## Overview

VolleyFlow now supports **flexible playoff advancement** for any number of teams, not just powers of 2. The system automatically suggests the optimal format (Auto-Byes or Play-In Matches) and handles bracket generation seamlessly.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Format Suggestion

The system analyzes the number of advancing teams and suggests the format that impacts the fewest teams:

- **Auto-Byes**: Top-seeded teams skip Round 1 and automatically advance to Round 2
- **Play-In Matches**: Lowest-seeded teams play extra matches to fill the bracket

### ðŸ“Š How It Works

For **N** teams advancing (where N is not a power of 2):

1. **Lower Power**: Largest power of 2 â‰¤ N (e.g., 8 for 10 teams)
2. **Higher Power**: Smallest power of 2 â‰¥ N (e.g., 16 for 10 teams)
3. **Byes Needed**: Higher - N teams would skip Round 1
4. **Play-In Teams**: (N - Lower) Ã— 2 teams would play extra matches

**Suggestion Logic**: Recommend **Play-In** if it impacts fewer teams than Byes.

### ðŸ“– Example Scenarios

#### 10 Teams Advancing
- Lower: 8, Higher: 16
- Byes: 6 teams idle
- Play-In: 4 teams playing extra matches
- **Suggested**: Play-In (4 < 6)
- **Result**: Seeds 7-10 play 2 play-in matches, winners join seeds 1-6 in main bracket (8 teams)

#### 12 Teams Advancing
- Lower: 8, Higher: 16
- Byes: 4 teams idle
- Play-In: 8 teams playing extra matches
- **Suggested**: Byes (4 < 8)
- **Result**: Seeds 1-4 get byes to Round 2, seeds 5-12 play Round 1 (4 matches)

#### 9 Teams Advancing
- Lower: 8, Higher: 16
- Byes: 7 teams idle
- Play-In: 2 teams playing extra matches
- **Suggested**: Play-In (2 < 7)
- **Result**: Seeds 8-9 play 1 play-in match, winner joins seeds 1-7 in main bracket

## Admin Workflow

### 1. Tournament Creation

When creating a Pool Play + Playoffs tournament:

1. Navigate to **Create Tournament**
2. Fill in basic tournament details
3. Configure **Pool Configuration** (number of pools, teams advancing per pool)
4. Set **Pool Match Rules**
5. Configure **Playoff Match Rules** (per round)
6. Arrange **Team Seeding** (drag-and-drop)

### 2. Advance Rules Section

The **Playoff Advancement Rules** section appears automatically for pool play tournaments:

- **Input**: Number of Teams Advancing (calculated from pools)
- **Live Suggestion**: System shows recommended format with math breakdown
- **Format Selection**: Choose Auto-Byes or Play-In (defaults to suggested)
- **Explanation**: Detailed description of what each format means

**Example Display**:
```
Suggested: Play-In
Byes: 6 teams skip Round 1
Play-In Teams: 4 teams play extra matches
Lower Bracket: 8 teams
Upper Bracket: 16 teams

Play-in is suggested because it impacts fewer teams (4 vs 6 idle).
```

### 3. Generating Playoffs

After pool play completes:

1. Navigate to tournament page
2. Click **"Advance to Playoffs"** button
3. System reads advance rules from draft
4. Generates bracket with byes or play-ins
5. Matches are created and linked automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms

```javascript
// Power of 2 helpers
function lowerPowerOfTwo(n) { return 2 ** Math.floor(Math.log2(n)); }
function higherPowerOfTwo(n) { return 2 ** Math.ceil(Math.log2(n)); }

// Smart suggestion
function suggestPlayoffFormat(numTeams) {
  const lower = lowerPowerOfTwo(numTeams);
  const higher = higherPowerOfTwo(numTeams);
  const byes = higher - numTeams;
  const playInMatches = numTeams - lower;
  const playIns = playInMatches * 2;

  return (playIns < byes)
    ? { suggestion: "play-in", byes, playIns, lower, higher }
    : { suggestion: "byes", byes, playIns, lower, higher };
}

// Seeding pairing
function pairSeedsForRound(seeds) {
  const pairs = [];
  let i = 0, j = seeds.length - 1;
  while (i < j) pairs.push([seeds[i++], seeds[j--]]);
  return pairs;
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Test Cases

1. **10 Teams**: Expect play-in with 2 matches (seeds 7-10)
2. **12 Teams**: Expect byes with 4 matches (seeds 5-12 in R1)
3. **9 Teams**: Expect play-in with 1 match (seeds 8-9)
4. **8 Teams**: No byes or play-ins needed (standard bracket)

### Verification Steps

1. Create pool play tournament with N teams
2. Configure pools so total advancing = test case
3. Check Advance Rules section shows correct suggestion
4. Complete pool play
5. Generate playoffs
6. Verify bracket structure matches expected format

## Backwards Compatibility

- Existing tournaments continue to work (no advance rules = standard behavior)
- Single elimination tournaments unaffected
- Power-of-2 pool tournaments work as before

## Future Enhancements

- Double elimination support
- Custom seeding adjustments after pools
- Re-seeding between playoff rounds
- Automatic tiebreaker rules for pool standings
