## üßÆ Core Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Power of Two Helpers
```javascript
lowerPowerOfTwo(10) ‚Üí 8
higherPowerOfTwo(10) ‚Üí 16
```

### 2. Smart Suggestion
```javascript
suggestPlayoffFormat(10) ‚Üí
  { suggestion: "play-in", byes: 6, playIns: 4, lower: 8, higher: 16 }
```

### 3. Seed Pairing
```javascript
pairSeedsForRound([1,2,3,4]) ‚Üí [[1,4], [2,3]]
```

### 4. Bracket Generation
- **Standard**: Power-of-2 teams, normal bracket
- **Byes**: Top seeds skip Round 1, rest play
- **Play-In**: Bottom seeds play extra, winners join top seeds

{
  "advanceRules": {
    "numTeamsAdvancing": 10,
    "suggestedFormat": "play-in",
    "formatChosen": "play-in",
    "math": { "byes": 6, "playIns": 4, "lower": 8, "higher": 16 }
  }
}
```

### Tournament
```json
{
  "phase": "playoffs",
  "advanceRules": { ... },
  "playoffs": {
    "seeds": [{ "teamId": "...", "teamName": "...", "seed": 1 }, ...],

      "play-in": { "matchIds": [...] },
      "round1": { "matchIds": [...] },
      ...
    }
