### 4. Frontend Components

#### Pool Components ‚úÖ
**Location**: `src/components/pools/`

**Files Created:**
1. **usePools.js** - Custom hook for real-time pool data
2. **usePoolStandings.js** - Custom hook for real-time standings
3. **usePoolMatches.js** - Custom hook for pool matches

if (match.matchType === MATCH_TYPE.POOL && match.poolId) {
  // Get tournament config
  const tournament = await getTournament(tournamentId);

  // Update pool standings
  await updatePoolStandings(
    tournamentId,
    match.poolId,
    { ...match, score1, score2, winner, setScores },

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Standings Calculation

**Triggered**: When admin approves a pool match

**Tiebreakers** (in order):
1. Points (wins √ó pointsPerWin)
2. Set differential
3. Point differential

**Updates**:
- Match count, W-L record
- Points earned
- Sets won/lost and differential
- Total points scored/conceded and differential
- Rank (auto-sorted)

### Cross-Pool Seeding Algorithm

**Step 1**: Collect top X teams from each pool
```
Pool A top 2: Team1 (rank 1), Team5 (rank 2)
Pool B top 2: Team3 (rank 1), Team7 (rank 2)
```

**Step 2**: Sort all advancing teams
```
Group by pool rank:
  1st place: Team1, Team3
  2nd place: Team5, Team7

Within each rank, sort by:
  - Points (desc)
  - Set differential (desc)
  - Point differential (desc)
```

**Step 3**: Assign overall seeds
```
Seed 1: Team1 (Pool A, rank 1, 9 pts)
Seed 2: Team3 (Pool B, rank 1, 9 pts)
Seed 3: Team5 (Pool A, rank 2, 6 pts)
Seed 4: Team7 (Pool B, rank 2, 6 pts)
```

**Step 4**: Generate bracket with seeded teams
```
Standard single-elimination with seeds
```

### Real-Time Features

**Firebase Listeners**:
- `subscribePools()` - All pools for tournament
- `subscribePoolStandings()` - Standings for specific pool
- `subscribeMatches()` - All matches (filtered by poolId)

**Auto-Updates**:
- Standings recalculate when match approved
- Pool status changes when all matches done
- UI reflects changes without page refresh
- Multiple users see same live data

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Before First Use:

1. **Deploy Database Rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only database
   ```

2. **Test Pool Creation**:
   - Create test tournament with 8 teams
   - Configure 2 pools, top 2 advance
   - Verify pools created correctly

3. **Test Pool Matches**:
   - Play through pool matches
   - Verify standings update
   - Check differentials calculate correctly

4. **Test Playoff Advancement**:
   - Complete all pool matches
   - Click "Advance to Playoffs"
   - Verify seeding correct
   - Verify bracket generates

5. **Test End-to-End**:
   - Full tournament from creation to completion
   - Verify real-time updates
   - Test with multiple browsers/users

---

## üìù Code Quality

- **Total Lines Added**: ~2,500+ lines of production code
- **Files Created**: 11 new files
- **Files Updated**: 5 existing files
- **Test Coverage**: Manual testing recommended
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline comments
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with fallbacks
- **TypeScript**: JSDoc comments for all functions

---

## üéì Key Learnings & Design Decisions

1. **Reuse Match System**: Pool matches use same infrastructure as playoff matches (scoreboard, submissions, approval) with `matchType` flag

2. **Standings Auto-Update**: Integrated into `approveScore()` so admins don't manually update standings

3. **Firebase Keys for Teams**: Team names encoded to handle special characters in Firebase keys

4. **Separate Pools Path**: Pools live at `/pools/{tournamentId}/{poolId}` for clean data organization

5. **Status-Driven UI**: Tournament status (`pool_play` vs `playoffs`) drives which tab/content shows

6. **Admin-Only Advancement**: Only admins can click "Advance to Playoffs" for fairness

7. **Flexible Pool Sizes**: Teams distributed evenly, handles odd numbers

8. **Cross-Pool Seeding**: Fair seeding across pools ensures best teams don't meet early in playoffs

## üêõ Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

**Current Limitations**:
- No head-to-head tiebreaker (4th tiebreaker)
- Pool configuration fixed after creation
- Cannot edit pools after tournament starts
- No Swiss-system support

**Potential Enhancements**:
- Pool re-seeding (admin can manually adjust)
- Support for uneven pool sizes
- Pool match scheduling (time slots)
- Automatic tournament progression (no manual "Advance" button)
- Export standings to CSV/PDF
- Pool play statistics dashboard
